## SSH

### Login without entering password

This section assumes you already generated ssh keys. You can follow [these](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) instructions (steps 1 and 2 only).

1. Copy your ssh keys into clipboard and paste the content of your key into the clipboard using the following instructions:

		sudo apt-get install xclip
		xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

2. ssh into desired pc, e.g.

		ssh user@youbot-brsu-2-pc1

    NOTE: you need an account for that on the youbot, if you don't have, you can ask Fred for one

3. Create authorized keys file

		nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

4. Paste the content of the clipboard there(`ctrl + shift + v`), save (`ctrl + o`, then enter) and close (`ctrl + x`)

5. Give proper permissions to the ssh folder and authorized keys file (current tests indicate this step is not needed)

		chmod 700 ~/.ssh
		chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Done! Now you should be able to log into the robot without entering password

### To open GUI applications in client PC

Example: gedit a file on youbot, but display it in your PC

		ssh -X youbot-brsu-2-pc1

### To tell your computer that the roscore is running on another PC and communicate accordingly trough the network.

Example: run some nodes in one computer and other nodes in another computer which can fully communicate with each other.

Drawback: the wifi speed will not allow you to transfer heavy data over the net.

Usage:

1. Set environment variable ROS_MASTER_URI to point to the PC in which the roscore is currently running:

		export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://youbot-brsu-2-pc1:11311

Done! Now in this terminal in which you executed the command the nodes will communicate with the roscore that is running in another computer.


### Remotely shut down the robot's computer: (requires sudo permission)

This assumes you have already ssh'd in the robot's PC

		sudo shutdown -h now
