### Installation

First of all make sure that vim is installed

```bash
sudo apt-get install vim
```

Copy the `.vimrc` file in this directory to your home directory as `.vimrc`. Assuming that you cloned this repository in your home folder you can do:

```text
cp ~/dotfiles/vim/.vimrc ~/
```

If it doesn't exist already, create a directory "autoload" inside `.vim`:

```text
mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload
```

Go to that directory:

```text
cd ~/.vim/autoload
```

Download the plugin:

```text
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim -o plug.vim
```

Enter vim:

```text
vim
```

Install all plugins by calling PlugInstall inside vim

```text
:PlugInstall!
```

Once it's done installing the plugins, in your `.vimrc` file go to line 17 and uncomment it.
