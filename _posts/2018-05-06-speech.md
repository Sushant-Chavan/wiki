# Speech

The speech package is run on Jenny's PC3 This will generate two files \(.bnf and .fcf\), which contain the speech commands in the form of a dictionary . The state machine receives one of this keys, and looks for the related words, while discarding the garbage.

## Packages

* `nuance_vocon_speech_recognition`: speech recognition
* `manyears_ros`: sound localization 8 sounds / Manyears

### Scripts

* `android_speech_recognition.py` define the path to the grammar file
* `command_states_speech.py` requires a string and just outputs the audio.

## Running the code

### Speech recognition

`roslaunch vocon_speech_recognizer vocon.launch`

The default grammar file is specified in:`vocon_speech_recognizer/data/general_purpose.bnf`.

Recognized speech is published on the topic:`/recognized_speech` Strings published to `/sound/say` are output to the speaker as audio

```text
rostopic echo /recognized_speech
rostopic echo /sound/say
rostopic pub /sound/say std_msgs/String "hello"
```

To generate new grammar files you can:  
a\) [https://gist.github.com/moriarty/20fbb331d90755a059ad7df30fba16ac](https://gist.github.com/moriarty/20fbb331d90755a059ad7df30fba16ac)  
b\) go to [http://edinburgh.uni-koblenz.de:8000/](http://edinburgh.uni-koblenz.de:8000/) and upload the grammar file \(.txt\).

#### In Jenny

Run the following:

```bash
cob3
roslaunch mdr_speech_and_audio speech_test.launch
```

In another terminal:

```text
cob1
rosrun mdr_speech_and_audio speech_test
```

once you run the `speech_test`

Say "begin test" or "start test" and then ask one of the questions from `/mcr_speech/mcr_question_matching/ros/config/questions.txt`

### ManyEars sound localization

Sound source direction is published on the topic: `/manyears/source_direction`

Parameter file which specifies arrangement of microphones on Jenny and other config: `manyears_ros/data/cob3-1.mes`

#### In Jenny

In addition to the `roscore` and `robot.launch`, run:

```bash
cob1
rosrun mdr_speech_and_audio turn_and_answer_test
```

In another terminal:

```text
cob2
roslaunch manyears_ros demo_8sounds.launch
```

And finally:

```text
cob1
roslaunch mdr_speech_and_audio turn_and_answer_test.launch
```

Speech synthesis is done on cob3 using the following node. It is launched by default with bringup. In case you reboot cob3 while bringup is running, relaunch this node:

```bash
cob3
roslaunch cob_bringup sound.launch
```

#### Calibration
