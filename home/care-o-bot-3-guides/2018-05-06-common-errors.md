# CAN Devices Not Recognised

This error might appear after upgrading the kernel on Jenny's PCs.

Reinstalling the CAN device driver is a working fix of the error. To ensure that there are no compatibility issues with the gripper, rather than installing a new version of the driver, the CAN driver in [`cob_extern`](https://github.com/mas-group/cob_extern) should be installed \(current stable version `7.15.2`\).
