# TMUX - Terminal Multiplexer

## Full Documentation

* [Project page](https://tmux.github.io/)
* [Manual Page](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/tmux.1)

## Why tmux

* Allow starting process in `ssh` sessions that continue to run when the user logsout
* Open the same session on multiple computers
* Hide irrelevant sessions to unclutter the terminal
* and many other things...

## Essential Usage

### In the terminal

* Start a new session: `tmux new -s <session_name>`
* List sessions: `tmux ls`
* Attach to an existing session: `tmux attach -t <session_name>`

### Within a session

The default bind key for tmux is `C-b` \(`Ctrl+b`\)

* `C-b + d`: detach \(session run as background\)
* `C-d` : exit \(kill session\), typing `exit` on all terminals also work
* `C-b + %`: vertical split
* `C-b + "`: horizontal split
* `C-b + :`: enter command
* `C-b + [`: enter scroll/copy mode
* `Esc` or `q`: exit scroll/copy mode

## \(More\) Advanced Usage

An user-specific config file for tmux should be located at `~/.tmux.conf`

* Enable scrolling by default: enter following command or add it to config file:
  * version 2.1 and up: `set -g mouse on`
  * older versions: `set -g mode-mouse on`
